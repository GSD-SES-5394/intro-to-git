# Github Tutorial

## Install Github Desktop

Git is a commandline application that you run from the terminal. Github also distributes an application called Github Desktop, which is a desktop application for Mac or Windows that may be a little easier to use.

To download github desktop, go to https://desktop.github.com

You may also need to confirm your email, and log in.

## Create a new Repository

While logged in to github, there should be a plus sign on the top right corner.

## Name your Repo

You can name it whatever you like, but don't put spaces or any funny characters like quote or slash. I would default to public unless this repo will have proprietary or secret information in it.

Github can also put a README file in our repo for us to get us started. Check that box. Hit the create repository button to get started.

## Clone the Repo
Our landing page for our repo should look something like this.

If you look at the address bar, you'll notice the pattern for github repos is https://github.com/<USER NAME/<REPO NAME>
